## Open Data portals
### [E-Gov](https://egov.kz/cms/en). Electronic Government of Republic of Kazakhstan
Most functions are available only if you have an IIN â€” [individual identification number](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-issue-focus/aeoi/kazakhstan-tin.pdf) of a resident of the republic. 

- IIN is the primary identifier for individuals. All resident's data is associated with it, from participation in legal entities to pension contributions and taxes. 
- The second important identifier is BIN - Business Identification Number - a unique number formed for a legal entity and an individual entrepreneur carrying out joint venture activities in the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
