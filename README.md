# OSINT-Tools-Kazakhstan
<img src="https://github.com/paulpogoda/OSINT-Tools-Kazakhstan/blob/main/Flag_of_Kazakhstan.svg.png" alt="Flag of Kazakhstan" style="height: 320px; width:640px;"/>
I have compiled a list of OSINT tools that may be useful to you when conducting investigations related to Kazakhstan. Would you like me to add more? Make a pull request.
Unless further clarified, the site or project has versions in Kazakh and Russian only. Some resources have English versions as well. 

Some functions are available only for residents of Kazakhstan. So for deeper OSINT, you have to find a friend in Kazakhstan (like me). Have you ever been there? No? Then you should
visit my Homeland — [Almaty](https://www.tripadvisor.ru/Attractions-g298251-Activities-Almaty.html)!
