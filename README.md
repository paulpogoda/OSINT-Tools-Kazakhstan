# OSINT-Tools-Kazakhstan
<img src="https://github.com/paulpogoda/OSINT-Tools-Kazakhstan/blob/main/Flag_of_Kazakhstan.svg.png" alt="Flag of Kazakhstan" style="height: 320px; width:640px;"/>
I have compiled a list of OSINT tools that may be useful to you when conducting investigations related to Kazakhstan. Do you want me to add more? Make a pull-request.
Unless further clarified, the site or project has versions in Kazakh and Russian only. Some resources have English language versions as well. 

Some functions are available only for residents of Kazakhstan. So for deeper OSINT, you have to find a friend in Kazakhstan (like me). Have you ever been there? No! Then you should
visit my Homeland — [Almaty](https://www.tripadvisor.ru/Attractions-g298251-Activities-Almaty.html)!

## Open Data portals
### [E-Gov](https://egov.kz/cms/en). Electronic Government of Republic of Kazakhstan
Most functions are available only if you have an IIN — [individual identification number](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/topics/policy-issue-focus/aeoi/kazakhstan-tin.pdf) of a resident of the republic. 

- IIN is the primary identifier for individuals. All resident's data is associated with it, from participation in legal entities to pension contributions and taxes. 
- The second important identifier is BIN - Business Identification Number - a unique number formed for a legal entity and an individual entrepreneur carrying out joint venture activities in the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
